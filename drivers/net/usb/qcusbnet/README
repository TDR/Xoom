1. PREREQUISITES

a. Kernel headers or full kernel source installed for the currently
   running kernel.  There must be a link "/lib/modules/<uname -r>/build"
   that points to these kernel headers or sources.
b. The kernel must support the usbcore and usbnet drivers, either as
   modules or built into the kernel.
c. Tools required for building the kernel.  These tools usually come in a
   package called "kernel-devel".
d. "gcc" compiler
e. "make" tool

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

a. Navigate to the folder "QCUSBNet2k" that contains:
      Makefile
      QCUSBNetHP.c
      QMIDevice.c
      qmidevice.h
      structs.h
      QMI.c
      qmi.h
b. (only required for kernels prior to 2.6.25) Create a symbolic link
   to the usbnet.h file in your kernel sources:
      ln -s <linux sources>/drivers/net/usb/usbnet.h ./
c. Run the command:
      make
d. Copy the newly created QCUSBNet2kHP.ko into the directory
   /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/usb/
e. Run the command:
      depmod
f. (Optional) Load the driver manually with the command:
      modprobe QCUSBNet2kHP
   - This is only required the first time after you install the
     drivers.  If you restart or plug the Gobi device in the drivers
     will be automatically loaded.

3. WHAT'S NEW

This Release (Gobi2000 network driver for HP 1.0.110) 06/18/2010
a. Correctly initialize semaphore during probe function.

Prior Release (Gobi2000 network driver for HP 1.0.100) 06/02/2010
a. Merge QCQMI driver into QCUSBNet2k driver, removing dependency.

Prior Release (Gobi2000 network driver for HP 1.0.90) 05/13/2010
a. Fix devqmi_close() from a thread
b. Add 2.6.33 kernel support

Prior Release (Gobi2000 network driver for HP 1.0.80) 04/19/2010
a. Add support to check for duplicate or out of sequence QMI messages.

Prior Release (Gobi2000 network driver for HP 1.0.70) 03/15/2010
a. Added support for CDC CONNECTION_SPEED_CHANGE indication.
b. Modified device cleanup function to better handle the device
   losing power during suspend or hibernate.
c. Replaced autosuspend feature with more aggressive "Selective suspend"
   style power management.  Even if QCWWAN2k or Network connections are
   active the device will still enter autosuspend after the delay time,
   and wake on remote wakeup or new data being sent.

Prior Release (Gobi2000 Serial driver for HP 1.0.60) 02/16/2010
a. Fix to allow proper fork() functionality
b. Add supports_autosuspend flag
c. Ignore EOVERFLOW errors on interrupt endpoint and resubmit URB
d. Change driver versions to match installer package
e. Minor update for 2.6.23 kernel compatibility

Prior Release (in correlation with Gobi2000-Linux-Package 1.0.30) 12/04/2009
a. Modify ioctl numbering to avoid conflict in 2.6.31 kernel
   This release is only compatible with GOBI2000_LINUX_SDK 1.0.30 and newer.
b. Made minor compatibility changes for 2.6.31 kernel

Prior Release (in correlation with Gobi2000-Linux-Package 1.0.20) 11/20/2009
a. Initial release

4. NOTES

a. In Composite mode, the Gobi device will enumerate a network interface
   usb<#> where <#> signifies the next available USB network interface.
b. In Composite mode, the Gobi device will enumerate a device node
   /dev/qcqmi<#>.  This device node is for use by the QCWWANCMAPI2k.
c. Ownership, group, and permissions are managed by your system
   configuration.
